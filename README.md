# README

This was a mockup design i followed.

It got informations about cruises from a api and then we would use it to create little cards with cruise details.It is live here on heroku:  
https://lit-woodland-29848.herokuapp.com/

Some of the things that i used in the project to make the layout responsive was.  
- Javascript to reposition elements as the layout for tablets, mobile and desktop was different.I used ` screen.width` with some simple code to get device's css pixels and place the element accordingly.
-Javascript to Display a price realtime on the bottom as users select the cruises.
-Media queries for tablet/mobile/desktop
-No bootstrap or other css frameworks were used.
